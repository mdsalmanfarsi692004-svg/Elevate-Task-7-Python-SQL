# Task 7: Sales Summary from a Tiny SQLite Database using Python

## 📌 Project Overview
This repository contains the solution for **Task 7** of the Elevate Labs Data Analyst Internship. The objective was to use SQL within Python to analyze a small dataset and visualize the results.

## 📂 Repository Contents
- **`Task7_Sales_Analysis.ipynb`**: The Python script/notebook containing the code to:
  - Create the SQLite database.
  - Run SQL aggregation queries.
  - Visualize data using Matplotlib.
- **`sales_data.db`**: The generated SQLite database file containing the sales table.
- **`sales_chart.png`**: A bar chart visualizing Total Revenue by Product.

## 🛠️ Tools Used
- **Language:** Python
- **Libraries:** `sqlite3`, `pandas`, `matplotlib`
- **Database:** SQLite (Embedded)

## 📊 Analysis Steps
1.  **Database Connection:** Connected to `sales_data.db` using the `sqlite3` library.
2.  **Data Creation:** Created a `sales` table and inserted mock transaction data.
3.  **SQL Query:** Executed the following query to calculate Total Quantity and Revenue:
    ```sql
    SELECT 
        product, 
        SUM(quantity) AS total_qty, 
        SUM(quantity * price) AS revenue 
    FROM sales 
    GROUP BY product
    ```
4.  **Visualization:** Created a bar chart using `matplotlib` to compare revenue across products.

## 📈 Results
The analysis identifies the revenue generated by each product category.
